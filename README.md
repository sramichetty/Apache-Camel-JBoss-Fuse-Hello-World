## Introduction to apache camel

Apache Camel is a mediation framework.What is a mediation framework?

In an enterprise network many types of systems exist some might be remote while others can be of legacy type and new type
we can write code that helps to bridge a connection between these two if there is any problem with the lgacy system then the entire code has to be redirected.Therefore apachae camel acts as mediator here!

At the core of the Camel framework is a routing engineâ€”or more precisely, a routing-engine builder. It allows you to define your own routing rules, decide from which sources to accept messages, and determine how to process and send those messages to other destinations. Camel uses an integration language that allows you to define complex routing rules, akin to business processes.
